  "experienceDescription1": "Since 2021, I have been working as a software tester at uTest, taking part in numerous quality assurance projects for web, mobile, and desktop applications, as well as conducting tests on physical devices to validate the integration between hardware and software.\n\n My work involves carrying out functional, regression, exploratory, usability, localisation, smoke, and in-home testing, with the aim of detecting issues at an early stage and enhancing the end-user experience. I place great importance on the quality of bug reports and documentation, recording reproduction steps, evidence, and severity levels to ensure clear communication with development teams.",
